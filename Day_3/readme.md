### Design Library cell using Magic Layout and ngspice characterization
The below command will create an folder called vsdstdcelldesign in the openlane directory.

The file inside the vsdstdcelldesign are :

Then we need to copy the tech file to the  vsdstdcelldesign folder.for that we use command

here we wont create an inverter from scrach,we will do spice extraction as well as post layout spice simulation of inverter design.
