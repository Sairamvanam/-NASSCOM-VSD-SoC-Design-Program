#  Chip Floor Planning considerations
### Utilization Factor

It is defined as the ratio of **area occupied by the netlist ** to **Total area of the core**.   
generally, we mention U.F = 0.6 that means  60% is used for placing the cells and remaining 40% is used for routing purpose.
If u.f = 1 ,then it means that core is completely occupied and addition of extra cells is not possible.
### Aspect Ratio
It is defined as ratio of Height and Width.
Aspect Ratio decides the shape. If A.R =1 ,that signifies Square shape.If A.R is other than 1 It will be Rectangle.
