GUNA software works on variables. These variables are available with us in order to fed into the software.

"slew" refers to the rate of change of voltage or current in a signal. Specifically, it describes how quickly the voltage or current transitions from one level to another.
slew_low_rise_thr: points towards the lower side of the power supply on input wave.



slew_high_fall_thr: points towards higher side of the power supply on output wave
