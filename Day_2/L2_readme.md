## Cell Design and Characterization Flow
A standard cell, refers to a pre-designed and characterized logic cell that performs a specific function. These cells are used as building blocks for designing more complex digital circuits. Standard cells are typically characterized by their functionality, timing characteristics, power consumption, and area.

Library consits of different cell with different functionality as-well-as different sizes and of different threshold voltages.
## Cell design Flow
cell design flow is divided into 3 stages.These stages are:
1.Inputs : These are the inputs that you need to design our Inverter.
2.Design steps : Then finally we will design the Inverter.
3.Output : Outputs of the inverter are the one that we actually use by the EDA tools.
